# planets
This is a demonstration projects allowing me to mess with cool math, display of results and the ability to create star charts.

Overview
  Planets is a program written to provide you primarily with data about the location of planets and stars and some other stuff
  that comes out of this ability.

Planets
  You can find the location of any of the major planets, the sun and the moon in various coordinate systems and from either a
  heliocentric or geocentric frame of reference.

Stars
  Stars may be displayed in various ways, and the resulting data ouput to a file.  The names of named stars may be printed as
  well.  There are data for 3169 stars in the program including what I believe are all stars with visual magnitude less than
  (brighter than) 8.

Constellations
  Constellations may be displayed with or without names.  All 88 are available

Rise, Set and Transit Times
  Geocentric rise, set and transit times are available for all of the planets and the moon

Astronomical Data
  This is a collection of mostly not very interesting values.

GHA and Dec
  This provides position information just as it appears in tables for navigation

Angular Separation
  Measures the geocentric angular separation between bodies.

Natal Chart
  Birth chart for time and location given

Time and Location Dialog
  This is the main input dialog for planets and stars.  Enter the time, location and bodies desired.  Then choose the type of
  information you want.

Equinoxes and Solstices
  Enter the year, and Planets finds the time of equinox and solstice for that year and the duration of each season.

Almanac
  Use Almanac to calculate a range of values.  See the Almanac section for details.

Magnetic Variation
Gives the magnetic variation of your location at that time.  Only good from 1900 through 2010.  This requires the file "igrf"
to reside in the same directory as your executable.

Moon
Finds times of moons's phases.
